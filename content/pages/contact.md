  Using National resonator guitars, harmonica and stand-up bass, Jeff “Felonius
  Smith” has developed a powerful sound reminiscent of the colorful tones
  created by the great Southern bottleneck blues players from the 1920’s and
  1930’s.


  He and his trio are available for festivals, concerts, private parties, and other special events – and Felonius also enjoys bringing the tradition of the blues’ heritage to schools in the community. He speaks about and performs examples of the history of blues guitar, providing students with insight into the times and circumstances of the old bluesmen and their songs – as well as the fascinating history of their often-preferred National (resophonic) guitar.
