text1: Performing acoustic delta, country, and folk blues, the Felonius Smith
  Trio carries on the exciting tradition of pre-war blues.
text: “ABOUT AS DOWN-HOME as they come, Felonius Smith demonstrates a tremendous
  familiarity with that old-fashioned toe-tapping music culled from last
  century's   acoustic Piedmont blues, country blues, Delta, ragtime, gospel and
  folk. With his standout finger-picking style and slide guitar expertise, Jeff
  “Felonius Smith” makes his playing seem as easy as a lazy afternoon on the
  front porch of some old Smoky Mountain retreat.”
